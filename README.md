# Pokédex

Hello, this is a pokédex project. It is possible to view a list of Pokémon and the details of each Pokémon. I developed using ReactJS with Hooks, React Redux. The API for get the pokemons is public, called [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Installation

First you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). The version used was `12.18.2`

After that, do you need clone the code using and install the dependencies:

```
    git clone https://github.com/JoaoCardoso02/Pokedex.git && cd Pokedex
    npm install
```

OK, after that, it is necessary to start the API:

```
    npm start
```

Ready, is it!
